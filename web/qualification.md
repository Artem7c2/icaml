The qualification within ICAML is envisioned to be as diverse as the various disciplines we want to connect. Many of our core
qualification modules will be  available in different formats: in extended formats for beginners or very concise (TL;DR) presentation.

For now, we are working towards the completion of the first presentations of the first  modules from the following canon.
<img src="gfx/canon.png" class="floater" />. The qualification is first organized into three levels: *Basics*, *Algorithms*, and *Case Studies*.
It is expected that people can select their modules of interest taking only into account that they are getting more and more advanced from
covering Basics with toy examples towards discussing algorithms in the context of real-world datasets.
