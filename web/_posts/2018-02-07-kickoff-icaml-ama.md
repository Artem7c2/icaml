# Kickoff for two BMBF-funded projects

Today, we had our joint kickoff for two BMBF-funded activites in machine learning at Leibniz-University of Hanover:

## The Interdisciplinary Center for Applied Machine Learning

This project is a joint project between the [Institut für Kartographie und Geoinformatik (IKG)](http://www.ikg.uni-hannover.de)
and the [Institut für Photogrammetrie und GeoInformation (IPI))](http://www.ipi.uni-hannover.de). We are working in the area
of spatial and geometric machine learning on earth-related, computer vision, and social applications. We are concentrating
on qualifying multiple disciplines in the context of geometric processing and image analysis.


The [https://ama-academy.eu](Applied Machine Learning Academy (AMA))
is a joint project of the L3S Research Center and the Institut für Fertigungstechnik und Maschinenbau (IFW) concentrating
on machine learning qualification for industrial applications. 

Both projects are working in close collaboration exchanging ideas, courses, and material. We are excited about both projects and will
work for better qualification in machine learning in Hanover and elsewhere.
