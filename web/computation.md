The heart of machine learning is to use computation in order to reveal insights from datasets. Therefore,
ICAML provides a unique computing platform consisting of hard- and software making it possible to learn and
explore machine learning from a browser and rightly deploy the knowledge anywhere: on your private hardware, your
companies infrastructure or a public cloud provider.

Therefore, the center relies on modern tools of software management known as containers. The idea is that software
is bundled together with the expected environment. This greatly simplifies the process of setting up a piece of software
and makes it possible to do so with not much more than a few actions.

The center is able to provide flexible computational resources, especially for interdisciplinary projects. Therefore, we can
provide temporary access to our compute cluster including GPU and large storage capacity.
