# Introduction to R

R is a programming language and originated in the field of statistics. It is widely accepted as the core language of data science.
As the core of the R language is functional, R has powerful features such as
applying algorithms to data in parallel and passing around functionalities. In addition, it adopted an approach in which a generic language
is valid for all objects. For example, calling
```
plot(A)
```
does something different depending on what A actually is. Therefore, packages in R often create canonical and well-suited visualizations and users
get those just by plotting the respective objects.
