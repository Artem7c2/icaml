# ICAML

Github of the [Interdisciplinary Center for Applied Machine Learning](http://www.icaml.org)

This repository is used to communicate, discuss and push forward the technology and contents that are
behind the computing platform of the center.

If you are a student, cluster user, or otherwise interested, this is the place to contribute: You need a python package?
No problem, submit a pull request with the needed changes to the appropriate Dockerfile and comment, why you need this package.

You need some course material? Some (not all) of our material will be available in this repository.

You are looking for the datasets? Sorry. They are not here. They are just too large for Github. However,
we try to document the origin and way of downloading / generating a specific dataset inside our platform.

# Repository Layout

For now, this repository just holds the stacks we are deploying on our cluster for several courses. Participants can
create an identical local environment on their own hardware.
